## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution for Huddle news landing page by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challange is to build a landing page from a design given by frontendmentor.

The users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
